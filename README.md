# Fundinghub 

## Installation instructions:
1. `$ truffle compile`
2. `$ testrpc / geth / parity`
3. `$ truffle migrate (--reset)`
4. `$ npm start`

## Notes:

> Because this app is bootstrapped with create-react-app, I included the node_modules directory. This project is ready to run as is.
> No need to run `npm install`

> Sadly the web application currently crashes when using safari `10.1.1 (12603.2.4)`.

> The web application is tested and found to be working in the following browsers:
> - Safari Technology Preview
> - Chrome
> - Firefox
